# BankTransactions
Basic reference implementation of a CRUD API in ASP.NET using PostgreSQL

Based on tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYmsoCWjvM4). 

## Notes

Instead of creating a new instance in a constructor we pass through a reference to the instance into the constructor from elsewhere with Dependency Injections.

Can remove most boilerplate in the prebuilt templates to create a CRUD API.
